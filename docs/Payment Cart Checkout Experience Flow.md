**Step 1: Cart Summary**  
  
* A user fills their cart with products from multiple merchants.  
* The cart displays a unified subtotal, shipping cost, and total cost, which are aggregated from the different merchants' products and shipping costs.  
  
**Step 2: Proceed to Checkout**  
  
* The user clicks the checkout button in the cart and is redirected to the checkout page.  
  
**Step 3: Review Orders**  
  
* On the checkout page, the user can:  
	• Review their orders, separated by merchant  
	• View each merchant's order details  
	• Fill out a form to set their shipping address and other details  
	• Provide different details for each merchant, if needed  (further development)
  
**Step 4: Communication and Payment**  
  
* Once the user has reviewed their orders, they can initiate communication with each merchant.  
* Payment Options:  
	• If the merchant has valid payment details, the user can pay directly.  
	• If the merchant lacks valid payment details, direct payment is not possible.  
	• Even if the merchant has valid payment details, the user can choose not to pay immediately and instead contact the merchant to ask questions or clarify details.  
* After completing checkout, a new direct message is sent from the user to the merchant.  
  
**Step 5: Order Management**  
  
* Order Entry Creation:  
	• If both parties are registered and non-paranoid users on the platform, a new entry is created in the orders table with the order details.  
	• The order status is set to "pending" if not paid, or "paid" if payment is successful.  
* Exceptions:  
	• If both users are unregistered or paranoid, no order entry is created.  
	• However, if the seller are registered and non-paranoid, but the buyer is paranoid or non-registered, an order entry is still created, in case of paranoid user the `buyer_user_id` public key can be encrypted using the merchant's key.  
* Order Management:  
	• If an order entry is created:  
	- The user and merchant can then view communication and order details/status in their dashboard.  
	• If no order entry is created, users can still maintain their communication in direct messages, but there is no order entry to manage.  
  
**Step 6: Merchant Order Management**  
  
* The merchant can:  
	• Confirm or cancel the order  
	• Provide updates by modifying the order details  
	• Mark the order as complete once shipped  
  
**Step 7: User Order Management**  
  
* The user can also mark the order as complete once received.  
* If both parties agree that the sale was successful, it is considered a verified sale.  
  
**Step 8: Conflict Resolution**  
  
* If the merchant attempts to defraud the user, the user can report this, which will impact the merchant's trustworthiness.  
* If the buyer attempts to defraud the merchant, the merchant can report this, which will impact the user's trustworthiness.  
* Conflict resolution is out of scope, and users should be disclaimed and aware of this limitation.
